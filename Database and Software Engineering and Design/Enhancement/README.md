# Databases and Software Engineering and Design from CS-320 Software Test Automation and QA

This is the enhancement performed for CS-499 Computer Science Capstone at SNHU, and the original artifact can be found [here](./Original).

The enhancement contains a JavaFX GUI, a MySQL DB, integration testing with TestContainers, and unit testing on the Models.

Automation is a huge part of any modern development process. This enhancement has a focus on creating a GUI with JavaFX, and integrating a MySQL database, but also implements Github Actions in order to test regressions on every push to the Main Branch. 

You can see more of what I accomplished on my Portfolio and viewing the [Database](https://samwalts.github.io/#databases) and the [Software Engineering and Design](https://samwalts.github.io/#software-engineering-and-design) sections.
