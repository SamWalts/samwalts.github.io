    How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, 
    which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? 
    How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
    
    By keeping variable names concise, but broad, you can write code that is easy to be reused. Providing an interface that is easily added to in the 
    future helps with reusing your code, especially something so crucial as a CRUD, which is the basis of almost all applications.
    
    How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 
    How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to
    meet other client requests?
    
    Solving on problem can be complicated, but solving a problem 100,000 times a seconds is a totally different ballpark. I like to first approach any issues by 
    first identifying the scope required, and then building my project and requirements off of that.
    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
    
    As a computer scientist, I was able to take data in a certain format, convert it into several different media, and republish it, using under two hundred lines of code,
    and off the shelf software and solutions. By cheaply and easily providing this, I was able to give this company and others an easy way to search a database for their required criteria.
